## Chapter 1: Introduction to Generative AI

**What is Generative AI?**

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of generating new content, whether it be text, images, music, or even entire video sequences. Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on recognizing patterns and making predictions, Generative AI creates novel data that mimics real-world examples.

**Historical Context**

Understanding the history of AI helps in appreciating the evolution of Generative AI. Early AI focused on rule-based systems, progressing to machine learning and, eventually, deep learning. Generative AI represents the cutting-edge application of these developments.

**Why Generative AI Matters**

Generative AI has the potential to transform industries by automating creative processes, enhancing personalization, and opening new possibilities in fields like entertainment, education, and healthcare.
